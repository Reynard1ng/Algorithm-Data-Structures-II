## Tested Environment
- macOS Catalina 10.15.4
- Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.29)


## Compile the code:
g++  graph_storage.cpp -o gs


## Parameters:
- please input 5 file directions in order
- dataset subtask2.in subtask2.out subtask3.in subtask3.out
- any illegal input may cause unpredictable errors


## Run:
We use the default file names as the example (retrieved from OBE):

./gs YouTube-u.txt 2.in 2.ans 3.in 3.ans

you can put those files with the excecutable file in the same direction

diff 2.ans 2.out

diff 3.ans 3.out

you can use those two orders to check if the answer is right.
