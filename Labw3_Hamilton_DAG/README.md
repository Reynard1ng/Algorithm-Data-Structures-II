## Tested Environment
- macOS Catalina 10.15.4
- Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.29)


## Compile the code:
g++  Hamilton-DAG.cpp -o HD


## Parameters:
- please input 2 file directions in order
- graph.in answer.out
- any illegal input may cause unpredictable errors


## Run:
We use the default file names as the example (retrieved from OBE):

./gs graph_100000.txt out_100000.txt

you can put those files with the excecutable file in the same direction

diff out_100000.txt ans_100000.txt

you can use this order to check if the answer is right.
