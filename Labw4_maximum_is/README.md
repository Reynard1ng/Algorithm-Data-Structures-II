## Tested Environment
- macOS Catalina 10.15.4
- Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.29)


## Compile the code:
g++  maximum-is.cpp -o MI **--std=c++11**


## Parameters:
- please input 2 file directions in order
- graph.in answer.out
- any illegal input may cause unpredictable errors


## Run:
We use the default file names as the example (retrieved from OBE):

./MI graph_10000.txt ans_100000.txt

The answer provided officially are just for referring. The maximum independent set in a graph is not unique.

You just need to check if the size of required independent set is right.
