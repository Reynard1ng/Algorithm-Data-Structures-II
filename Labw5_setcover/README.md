## Tested Environment
- macOS Catalina 10.15.4
- Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.29)


## Compile the code:
g++  setcover.cpp -o SC 


## Parameters:
- please input 2 file directions in order
- setdata.in ans.out
- any illegal input may cause unpredictable errors


## Run:
We use the default file names as the example (retrieved from OBE):

./SC ans_100_20.txt ans_100_20.txt

The answer provided officially is just for referring. This program implement an approximate algorithm of solving set cover problem. So the answer is not accurate.

You just need to check if the answer is reasonable.
