丁海鹏,2018202045,2020-5-7


## Tested Environment
- macOS Catalina 10.15.4
- Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.29)


## Compile the code:
g++  IS-greedy.cpp -o ISG -std=c++11 -O2

(g++ IS-randshuf.cpp -o ISR -std=c++11 -O2)


## Parameters:
- please input 1 file directions in order
- graph.txt 
- any illegal input may cause unpredictable errors


## Run:
We use the default file names as the example (retrieved from OBE):

./ISG wiki-Talk.txt

The size of independent set and the answer calculated by another algorithm provided officially is just for referring. My program puts the apprpoximation answer to the standard error. 

You just need to check if the answer is reasonable.
