## Tested Environment
- macOS Catalina 10.15.4
- Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.29)


## Compile the code:
g++  Walker.cpp -o W


## Parameters:
- please input 2 file directions in order
- Data_Week7.txt out.txt 
- any illegal input may cause unpredictable errors


## Run:
We use the default file names as the example (retrieved from OBE):

./W Data_Week7.txt

The program uses the default random seed for generating random numbers. So the output of my program is fixed for the particular data. The size of sampling is small, which cannot reflect the connection between samples and the value of all the elements.

You just need to check if the answer is reasonable.
